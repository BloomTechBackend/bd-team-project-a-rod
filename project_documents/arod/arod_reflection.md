# A-Rod Reflection

## Instructions

1. *Create a new folder within this current folder, and name the new folder
   after your team name*
2. *If you prefer keeping this reflection private to your team, you may change
   the permissions on your folder so that only your teammates + unit instructors
   can view the contents*
3. *Create a copy of this reflection template, and put it in your newly created
   folder *

*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
  underway?
* Answer: I followed the design pretty closely with only minor tweaks needed along the way.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* Answer: Handled it by brainstorming on a whiteboard and by using the Music Playlists project to get ideas.
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
* Answer: I would run through the code and mentally imagine what is supposed to happen and where I might be misunderstanding. And would also just take breaks to allow the solution to come to me. Or I would use chatgpt for inspiration.
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
* Answer: I didn't make a team charter since I did it solo.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
* Answer: I didn't have daily standups as I worked by myself.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
* Answer: I underestimated it, it took me twice as long as I thought. I learned that things are always a bit more complex than you would think initially so potentially double what your immediate instinct is.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
* Answer: I think I would just do the things that I did right faster, and make less mistakes. But overall, I think my process was pretty good, I just have more muscle memory now and experience to do it faster with less mistakes.
